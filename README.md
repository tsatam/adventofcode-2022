# Advent of Code - 2022

Solutions to Advent of Code, done in Go as a language learning exercise. 

## Personal Goals (will likely change as AoC2022 progresses)

1. Keep solutions simple - ideally contained within a single main.go file
2. Prioritize using Go standard library over third party ones
3. Have a comfortable level of tests - not too many
